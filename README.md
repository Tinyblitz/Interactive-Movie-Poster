# Interactive-Movie-Poster

// A class project where the only prompt was to make an interactive poster.  I decided to go with a movie poster. 

// The concept is using a digital movie poster to allow the audience to engage with the characters in the movie and learn more about them.

// It picks up speech (English) as the input.  Each character has unique interactions taken from various forms of media associated with the film. Currently those interactions are limited to one per character for 3 total characters. You speak keywords to interact, such as saying the character's name to call them.  And saying "Bye" to have them leave.

// Speak loud and clearly and make sure to enunciate.  It might not pick up strong accents. The speech library used is a bit finicky.  You may need to reload the page at times.
